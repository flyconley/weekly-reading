## A Checklist For First-Time Engineering Managers
>  原文地址：<https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/checklist-for-first-time-managers/>

The most visible change in moving to management is you get a lot less feedback. When you're an engineer, you get feedback on your code, on your design documents, or how your projects are going. As a manager, you have none of this. There are also often no clear and specific expectations of what you should be doing in this role.

进入管理层后，最明显的变化是你得到的反馈少了很多。当你是一名工程师时，你会得到关于代码、设计文档或项目进展情况的反馈。作为一名经理，你没有这些。对于你应该在这个岗位上做什么，通常也没有明确和具体的期望。

I noticed the many parallels between an engineer managing a project the first time and a new manager starting to manage a team. In either case, they've not done this work before: and an opinionated list can prove much more helpful than general advice.

我注意到一个工程师第一次管理一个项目和一个新经理开始管理一个团队之间有许多相似之处。无论哪种情况，他们以前都没有做过这样的工作:一份明确的清单可能比一般性建议更有帮助。

The expectations are split into these areas:

1. Team building and teaching. Build trust on the team, execute on hiring (if they have headcount), and develop people on their team.
2. Deliver results. Ensure the team has a structure to execute on, get things done, and keep a high quality bar.
3. Collaborate and connect. Keep an open communications channel with the team, connect people and teams, and run good meetings.
4. Vision. Ensure the team has a purpose and collect team values. Involve the team in planning for what the team will do.
5. Professional growth. Keep growing as a person: set their own goals, work with a mentor, network with peers and give back.
