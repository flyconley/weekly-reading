本文是 Hacker news 上关于软件工程师职业素养的总结

#### Tools and Technical Proficiency
举了一个flash的例子，过去flash是一项很流行的技术，但现在这项技术慢慢过时了，之前花在钻研flash上的时间在某种意义上讲被浪费掉了。然而对于程序员来说，掌握相关的框架依然是非常必要的。

文章的结论是: Regarding technical proficiency as the ladder to mastery

#### Mighty Trade-offs
expert engineers are able to avoid work that does not provide value and this could be their greatest skill

So, Novice engineers will struggle to get something done, running with the first solution that comes to mind, letting confirmation bias drive them. while Intermediate engineers can get things done but fail to see the tradeoffs and an Expert engineer can identify possible solutions with different approaches

讨论了 Trade-off 的问题，一个问题可以有多种解决方案，权衡优劣的能力是 Novice engineers 和 Expert engineer 之间的差距

#### Shipped to hours worked

The common characteristics across these highly accomplished programmers who are leading a legion of programmers in their respective fields, as developer outlines, are extremely effective at getting things done, hardworking, and specially laser focused on shipping

最优秀的团队成员可以引导整个团队远离毫无价值的工作。然而某种程度上来说，这是团队大佬的特权

A developer comments, that position of privilege is earned, when a senior engineer knows what the highest-value work is and is influencing/driving the roadmap. A Senior Engineer says ‘no’ more often than ‘yes’ and backs it up with a ‘why’.

#### Spiralling Complexity

Mastery is all about managing complexity, many developers agree in the discussion. Masterful code has some kind of straightforward simplicity, everything is predictable and boring. You can see how programmer was thinking and how well program structure was planned.

大道至简

But a master works through that, continues another developer, they are able to build systems such that the cost of adding more value to the system remains constant as the system grows in complexity.

#### Journeyman

Mastery is difficult to quantify, especially in terms of code or engineering cleverness. There is just too much change and evolution in this field of software development for that to ever be true
 
技术永远在进步和发展之中，there’s no such thing as master
 
也许从反面来思考更好: There is however a baseline at the other end … if it’s not functional and maintainable, there’s a definite lack of mastery

#### The wise Owl

You can never truly be perfect, you can only approach it. Understanding your limitations is just as important as understanding your capabilities. Depth vs breadth is hard and you only have so much life to go so deep into so many domains

你永远不可能真正做到完美，你只能接近完美。了解你的局限性和了解你的能力一样重要。深度和广度是很难的，你只有那么多的生命去深入那么多的领域

软件工程是一项团队运动。你需要知道如何在所有相关的工程领域中编写设计文档、测试计划、架构计划、进度报告和文档。如果你不能有效地传达你的设计，或者不能有策略地传达为什么别人的东西是好是坏，那么你就不能让别人相信你是对的。
