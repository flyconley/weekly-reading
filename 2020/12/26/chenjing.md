## Life is Short
> 原文地址：<http://paulgraham.com/vb.html>

#### Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness?
作者的回答是 life actually is short，举了一个例子，他从孩子3岁到10岁的时间里，只与其共度了8次美妙的圣诞节，即使这8年的时间看似很长，但取出具体的时点来看，是很短暂的。

#### There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you. 
当你回想起你所度过的时间，你会发现大量的时间过得毫无意义，这些无意义的时间花在了两类事情上：为了生活奔波，被自己所欺骗

#### But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own.
生活的奔波有时是出于无奈，但自身潜移默化的虚度光阴更多的是自己的原因，而且相对于外界的压力更难消除

As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become more addictive. Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions — to stand outside ourselves and ask "is this how I want to be spending my time?"

随着技术的进步，我们对喜爱的东西越来越容易上瘾，有时会让我们忘记思考，这些让我们上瘾的东西真的不是在虚度光阴吗？

#### As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. 
找到对自己真正重要的东西，
One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. 真正重要的事物不是看现在，而是未来你回想起这件事的时候，你是否依然觉得重要

#### If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone.
生命真的很短暂，你总是期待着去做那些精彩的事情，那些想要攀登的山峰，想要读的书籍，想要与家人共度的美好时光……可是却沉沦在日复一日的消磨中，那些期待的事情，终究没能完成

#### The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it.
虽然我们没有必要时刻提醒自己生命转瞬即逝，但是那些自己想做的精彩的事情，想到了就去做吧，不要再等待了。You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

#### I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. 
我们可以通过改善生活方式来增加生命的长度，也可以通过让生活更有意义来增加生命的深度。

#### Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.
对于如何更好地度过自己的生命，作者最后总结了这三点建议。本文虽然是一篇鸡汤，读起来却让我有了很深的共鸣，作者举了生活中的很多例子，这些例子仿佛就发生在我们身边，让我感同身受。的确生命太过短暂，希望自己可以更加珍惜今后的日子，活出精彩。
