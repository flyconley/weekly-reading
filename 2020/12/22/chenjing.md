## To listen well, get curious
> 原文地址：<https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/>

在许多关于人际关系的书籍里有这样的建议：often when people complain, they don’t want help, they just want you to listen!

但对此作者提出了不同的看法：This always used to seem silly to me. If I complain at my partner and she “just listens,” I’ve accomplished nothing except maybe made her empathetically sad. When I complain at people, I want results, not to grouse into the void!

仅仅听着或者机械式的回应，只是在模仿良好倾听的表面表现，但忽略了真正重要的东西：The generator is curiosity. 保持好奇心是良好倾听的关键

好的倾听者应该努力深入地去了解倾诉者所谈的细节，只有充分了解问题，才能提出有效的建议，否则拍脑袋提出的建议，还不如仅仅听着或者机械式的回应
It turns out that reality has a surprising amount of detail, and those details can matter a lot to figuring out what the root problem or best solution is. So if I want to help, I can’t treat those details as a black box: I need to open it up and see the gears inside. Otherwise, anything I suggest will be wrong—or even if it’s right, I won’t have enough “shared language” with my friend for it to land correctly.

What’s really going on is probably that your advice is bad, because you didn’t really listen, because you weren’t curious enough.

当我好奇别人在说什么时，我通常会用自己的话复述给他们听。但这是因为我真的很好奇，而不是像书上一样机械式的回应。把他们的想法用我自己的话表达出来，表明我已经完全消化了它，这有助于我们建立一种共同的语言来谈论它。

So the right advice isn’t “listen harder and repeat everything back”—you won’t be genuine if you’re just imitating the surface appearance of a good listener. Instead, be humble and get curious! Remind yourself that there’s a ton of detail behind whatever you’re hearing, and try to internalize all of it that you can.
