> 原文地址：<https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/performance-review-biases/>

This article summarizes the 8 common biases I've observed in performance reviews and how you - as someone receiving this review - can counter them.

good managers should consciously reduce biases in any performance review.

### How Specific Feedback are You Getting?
#### Specific feedback
- the STAR model(Situation, Task, Action, Result): here's the situation you were in, what your task was, what you were expected to do, what you did and the result
- you both know what you are talking about: and this makes for generally healthy exchanges.
#### Generic feedback
- When you notice generic feedback, aim to turn it into something specific.
- When you confirm what your manager is thinking, ask for specifics: and tell them you need specifics to digest the feedback.
#### Speculative feedback 
-  your manager tells you things that you could do or could have done, often without much specifics.
-  Speculative feedback is often a lazy form of feedback
-  When you get speculative feedback, challenge why your manager is saying this.

**Quality performance feedback is specific, and it is fair game for you to ask for this from your manager**

### Recency Bias
- How to spot it: if you only hear of things in the recent past, this bias might be in play.
- How it can work in your favor: if you delivered something outstanding recently, and your manager refers to this frequently in your review, this might result in a more positive review
- How to counter it: Keep a log of the work you do, and send over a self-review or work log to your manager before performance reviews start.

### Strictness Bias
This bias happens when your manager is overly strict in their evaluation with a few people
- How to spot it: If you feel that your manager is nitpicking or holding an unusually high bar, they might be biased with strictness.
- How it can work in your favor: On the long term, if you embrace the "strictness" and work to prove your manager wrong, you might grow faster. 这一点我不能完全认同，不能排除对方恶意的PUA行为
- How to counter it: when the feedback is generic or speculative, ask for specifics to talk about. Strictness bias often comes from your manager, not knowing too much about your work.

### Leniency Bias
- your manager going overly "easy" on you.
- you'll get a better and nicer review!

---
### Horns Bias
This bias refers to one negative attribute or behavior being generalized in the mind of the manager, unfairly pulling the whole performance review down.
- How to spot it: 
1. 对某个领域或某个事件给出强烈的负面反馈，并在其他地方不断提起这件事
2. 认为你的直接“搞砸了”一个重要的项目，或者从经理信任的人那里得到一两个负面反馈
- How to counter it: 
1. identify what this big, negative trait or behavior might be
2. remind your manager that it feels like horns bias to have a one-off incident impact your whole performance review outside of just one area.

---
### Halo Bias
a single positive event/attribute pulls your whole review up, across the board.
- How to spot it: you'll get an overly positive review from your manager after you've done something really great for the team.
- How it can work in your favor:  you might not get feedback on some of your growth areas.
- How to counter it: ask your manager what the top area for further improvement that they can see is.

---
### Similarity Bias
humans tend to favor other humans who look or feel similar to them. 
- How to counter it:
1. spend more time with your manager.Get to know them. Share your background. Share a lot more about your work and how you approach things. Ask for frequent feedback on your performance. Set goals together.
2. If this persists, the solution might be to find a new manager or team.
- A note for managers: It's on you to reduce the likelihood of this happening. Double-check your language and attitude with people who are not similar to you on the team. Spend time to understand their background and way of working.

### Central Tendency Bias
If you ask a manager to rate people on their team from 1 to 5, with no constraints, many managers would be tempted to give everyone a 3.
- How to counter it: when you are getting a "very average" review, push your manager to identify a strength and a growth area.

### The Contrasting Bias
you might get a review that is relative to others, not to what the objective bar is.

As your manager describes, take notes. You're now doing the work they should have done: collecting what the expectation is.

### Focus on the Feedback You Can Grow From

1. Try to find the parts of the feedback that are actionable and ones that you want to get better at. 
2. When you disagree with the feedback, try paraphrasing over getting immediately defensive.
